                <h2>What is AI?</h2>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad area of computer science that makes machines seem like they have human intelligence. The goal of AI is to create systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
                <p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Neural Networks & Deep Learning</h2>
                <p>Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. These networks, with their many layers, are the workhorses behind many of the most exciting AI applications today, from self-driving cars to advanced medical diagnostics.</p>

                <h2>What is Cyber Security?</h2>
                <p>Cyber Security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The field is becoming increasingly important because of the growing reliance on computer systems and the internet.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Network Security:</strong> The practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application Security:</strong> Focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data it's designed to protect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Information Security:</strong> Protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operational Security:</strong> Includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets.</li>
